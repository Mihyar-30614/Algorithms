# Problem G: Meeting Points
This problem is very simple. Given n lines lying in the x-y
plane, determine the number of intersection points. Here are the details:
1. Each line is specified by two distinct points, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), through which the line passes.
2. All n lines are distinct, i.e., no two lines will be coincident (lie on top of each other).
3. You are guaranteed that there is no point in the plane at which three or more lines intersect.
