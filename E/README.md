# Problem E: Largest Hoarding
The real estate market in Metropolis is flourishing, and the main street in downtown Metropolis is now
lined with a continuous row of high-rise buildings. Not surprisingly, advertisers have been eager to
put up large hoardings on the walls of these buildings. (For those unfamiliar with this use of “hoarding”,
it is another word for “billboard” in many parts of the world.) After weighing the social and
environmental impacts, the Metropolis city council decided to impose a ban on advertising hoardings
along the main street. Following an intense legal battle, however, advertising agencies recently won a
victory over the city’s hoardings ban when the high court declared the ban unconstitutional. The high
court also recognized some of the merits of the ban, though, and ruled that hoardings may only be put
up parallel to the main road, along the walls of the skyscrapers lining the road, and that no hoarding
may extend outside the skyline at any point.

As an account executive for a well-known advertising agency in Metropolis, you are excited by the
high court’s decision. Recently, ABC Inc., a multinational retail corporation, hired your agency to
design and install an advertisement hoarding for its new apparel business. In order to maximize its
impact, ABC wants the size (surface area) of this hoarding to be as large as possible. You are handling
ABC’s request, and hence you are busy calculating the largest possible billboard you can install, and
therefore the largest amount of revenue your agency can collect from ABC each month. In Metropolis,
the standard monthly cost of an advertisement hoarding is $50 per square metre.
