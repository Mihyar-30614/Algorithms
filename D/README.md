# Problem D: ARMPIT Computations
The popular ARMPIT processor has a simple architecture that is built around a single register that is
12 bits long. The most significant bit is viewed as being at the left end, with the least significant bit
at the right end. The contents of the register are often represented as an unsigned integer written in
base 10.
