# Problem F: Post Carriers of the Galaxy

You are a space postal carrier. Your job is to deliver parcels in your spaceship from planet to planet.
The number of parcels you can deliver depends on how much gas you need to carry in your ship to
make a jump from one planet to another. The less gas you need to carry, the more parcels you can
deliver, and the richer you become. You can refuel along the way at any planet that you stop at. And,
since you work for the United Federation of Planets Postal Service, time and the amount of gas used
is irrellevant. (It does not matter how many jumps you need to make as long the parcels are delivered.)
Given a star map, you need to figure out the smallest possible fuel tank that your ship will need to
deliver to any of the planets. The amount of gas needed to make a jump between two planets is
proportional to the distance between the two planets. I.e., a distance of 2 light years takes 2 litres of
plasma fuel. Note that fuel tanks are in integer sizes, e.g., 2 litres, 3 litres, 4 litres, etc.
Write a program that reads in the locations of all the planets and determines the smallest possible fuel
tank (in litres) that your ship will need.
